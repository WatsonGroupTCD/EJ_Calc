!This program requires a file having the spin densities for the system !of
!interest in different electronic configurations and the energy !associated with
!the system in that electronic configuration. This file can be generated !using
!the program spin_dens_extrctr. Besides this, the program requires !another file
!having details about the number of magnetic centres and the !Hamiltonian. Using
!these two files, this program lets one calculate all possible J values !for the
!system. If you have data for n configurations and you need j coupling !constants
!then this program calculates all nCj coupling constants (provided n>j).
!In each !calculation you need to sacrifice one equation. Thus you basically end
!up with !n sets of (n-1)Cj coupling constants, all of which are calculated. The
!average !per set and the total average of the coupling constant is also
!calculated.

!All subroutines called here are in the modul_lib.f90 file unless specified
!otherwise
