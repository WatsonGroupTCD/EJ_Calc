!This program requires a file having the spin densities for the system of
!interest in different electronic configurations and the energy associated with
!the system in that electronic configuration. This file can be generated using
!the program spin_dens_extrctr. Besides this, the program requires another file
!having details about the number of magnetic centres and the Hamiltonian. Using
!these two files, this program lets one calculate all possible J values for the
!system. If you have data for n configurations and you need j coupling constants
!then this program calculates all nCj coupling constants (provided n>j). In each
!calculation you need to sacrifice one equation. Thus you basically end up with
!n sets of (n-1)Cj coupling constants, all of which are calculated. The average
!per set and the total average of the coupling constant is also calculated.



!This program calculates the J values using the formal spin density irrespective
!of the type of spin density provided in the spin density file. It converts the
!spin density to integer values by rounding them to the closest integer.
!Additionally, this program removes all singular solutions i.e. the solutions in
!which at least one of the equations becomes completely zero.


!It is recommended that you run this program in conjunction with the next
!version because that uses the spin density values which are provided in the
!spin density file but at the same time does not calculate the set of equations
!that were found to be singular by this code.
